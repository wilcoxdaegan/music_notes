# music_notes
A simple JavaFX flashcard application used for studying music notes. It uses handmade "flashcards" of completely random notes anywhere on the staff in both treble and bass clef, up to 3 ledger lines both top and bottom. I created this app with the intention of saving myself some printing and paper - instead of going through music books upon music books labelling notes to learn how to read sheet music better, I thought it would be a fun exercise coding a solution instead. I still use this program daily.

One of the biggest challenges I face was exporting it to a .jar file, then packing it into a .exe file. Learning about the changes from old versions of Java to newer ones, JavaFX became much more complex. Ultimately, I found the best solution was to just revert to Java 1.8, which allowed everything to work properly. 

A way to improve this app would be to give choices on studying specific clefs, adding alto clefs, or becoming more Anki-like and adding data analysis tools based on how the user responds.
